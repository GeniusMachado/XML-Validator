I have created an XML file with the example of a Library and then created its Schema and also the DTD. 
The java programs in this repository is used to parse and validate the respective .xsd and .dtd and .xml files.
The Java Parser in this repository validates the XML against the Schema (.XSD file) and the DTD (.DTD file)
respectively. To validate the XML against the schema or the DTD, you just have to have all the files in 
the same package and run the repective Java codes to get the validation result.
Note: The parser uses standard libraries and packages so the need to import external packages or install
additional modules never really arises. Run the XML DOM Parser and the DTD validator to test your XML.
